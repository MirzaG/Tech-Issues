Slow System Network Preferences on Mac

Problem:
When you open System Preferences and then click on Network, network dialog opens up but takes way long to load networks or simply never loads. 

Solution:
It is majorly due to unnecessary networks(mainly VPN connections) added in you network list. So we need to remove some of them to run it 
smoothly.

Fix:
- Open the finder, press 'Cmd + shift + G' and paste this: /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist copy the
  preferences.plist file somewhere just for backup. right click and open with text-editor.
- Find the 'NetworkServices' key like <key>NetworkServices</key>, it contains <key> & <dict> tags. delete everyting enclosed between <key> & </key> and <dict> to </dict>.
  Also remove these tags itself. By rule of thumb you should start from bottom.
- Due to permission issues you will need to 'Save As' file somewhere on desktop and then copy paste to original location.

Now first close Settings by right clicking on Settings icon, and hit 'Quit'. Now it should work fine.


Let me in case you find any issue with it.

Enjoy.
