Sourcetree error RPC failed curl 56 LibreSSL SSL_read: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL, errno 54
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
fatal: ealry EOF
fatal: index-pack failed


Fix:
- Open '.gitconfig' file in home folder. In case of MAC it will be in root path of your user like 'Mac HD/Users/(User name)' and in windows
find it in 'C' drive. 
- Add this text to it and save, restart sourcetree.
[init] templatedir = /Applications/SourceTree.app/Contents/Resources/git_local/share/git-core/templates

Let me know in case of issues.

Thanks
